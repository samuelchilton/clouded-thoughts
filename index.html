            Welcome to Clouded Thoughts, a place where ideas float freely like clouds in the sky. Clouds you leave behind are shared with other users until they are supplanted by the next 100 ideas. 
            <br/>
            This app was created by me, Sam, as a way to experiment with Claude Code. It's pretty amazing how easy it was to create this.
            <br/>
            This app collects no user data. It accepts thoughts that you submit, generates a timestamp in UTC time, and collects nothing else. It is also unmoderated, so please do not post illegal or rude things here.
